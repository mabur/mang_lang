<h1>Manglang</h1>
<p>
Manglang is an <b>experimental</b> programming language that is <b>simple</b> and <b>minimal</b>.
It is suitable for describing data and calculations, but not interactive programs with side effects. Manglang code can either be evaluated using its stand-alone interpreter or be embedded as a scripting language within C++.
</p>

<h1>Code Evaluation</h1>
<p>
Manglang is a functional and interpreted language.
It takes source code written in Manglang and evaluates it.
Consider the following input program:
</p>
<pre>
{
  rectangles = [
    {width = 3 height = 1}
    {width = 6 height = 2}
    {width = 3 height = 6}
    {width = 8 height = 4}
  ]
  get_area = in {width height}
    out mul!(width height)
  areas = map!(get_area rectangles)
  total_area = add!areas
  num_rectangles = count!rectangles
  average_area = div!(total_area num_rectangles)
}
</pre>

<p>
When we evaluate the input above we get the output below:
</p>
<pre>
{
  rectangles = [
    {width = 3 height = 1}
    {width = 6 height = 2}
    {width = 3 height = 6}
    {width = 8 height = 4}
  ]
  get_area = in {width height}
    out mul!(width height)
  areas = [3 12 18 32]
  total_area = 65
  num_rectangles = 4
  average_area = 16.25
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that both the input and output of the Manglang interpreter is given as Manglang code!
The Manglang format can be used to both write programs and to express pure data.
It can for instance be used as a programmable configuration language.

</p>

<h1>Building Blocks</h1>
<p>
Manglang consists of the following basic building blocks:

</td>

</table>
<p>
Below you will find descriptions and examples of each of these language constructs.
</p>

<h1 id="atoms">1. Atoms<img src="atom.png" width=48 height=48></h1>
<p>
Manglang has three kinds of atomic or primitive data: numbers, characters and booleans.
</p>

<h2 id="numbers">1.a. Numbers</h2>
<p>
Manglang has a single number type which is a 64 bit float:
</p>
<pre>
12.34
</pre>

<h2 id="characters">1.b. Characters</h2>
<p>
A single ascii character is written as:
</p>
<pre>
'a'
</pre>

<h2 id="booleans">1.c. Booleans</h2>
<p>
A boolean is either:
<pre>
yes
</pre>
or
<pre>
no
</pre>
</p>
In Manglang we see booleans as answers to questions and therefore write them as <code>yes</code> and <code>no</code> instead of <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. This is closer to natural language and also shorter.

<h1 id="containers">2. Containers<img src="container2.png" width=48 height=48></h1>
<p>
Manglang has five different kinds of containers which can store other data inside them: dictionaries, tuples, stacks, strings, tables.
</p>

<h2 id="dictionaries">2.a. Dictionaries</h2>
<p>
Dictionaries are used to associate names / symbols with expressions:
</p>
<pre>
{pi=3.14 first_letter='A'}
</pre>
<p>
Manglang doesn't care about extra whitespace so the program above can also be written as:
</p>
<pre>
{
  pi = 1
  first_letter = 'A'
}
</pre>
<p>
Dictionaries can be nested:
</p>
<pre>
{
  rectangle = {width = 4 height = 5}
  circle = {radius = 5}
}
</pre>

<h3 id="reference">Reference to Current Dictionary</h2>
<p>
A name defined in a dictionary can be referenced after it is defined:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = 1
  b = a
}
</pre>
<p>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = 1
  b = 1
}
</pre>
<h3 id="reference">Reference to Outer Dictionaries</h2>
<p>
Dictionaries can be nested. You can also refer to a name in an outer dictionary:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = 1
  b = {c = 2 d = a}
}
</pre>
<p>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = 1
  b = {c = 2 d = 1}
}
</pre>
<p>
When refering to a name the current dictionary is first checked and then the next outer dictionary and so on.
</p>

<h3 id="child_reference">Reference to Inner Dictionary</h2>
<p>
You can refer to names in an inner dictionary like this:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = {b=2 c=3}
  d = b@a
}
</pre>
<p>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = {b=2 c=3}
  d = 2
}
</pre>
<p>
The syntax <code>name@dictionary</code> is used to get the value corresponding to the name/key inside the dictionary.
This syntax is reversed compared to most languages that instead write this as <code>dictionary.name</code>.
However, having it like this simplifies the syntax of Manglang and makes it easier to parse.
It also makes both function application and dictionary lookup follow the same order and pattern. 
</p>

<h3>Dictionaries everywhere</h3>
<p>
In Manglang dictionaries are the only way to associate names / symbols with expressions.
So Manglang uses dictionaries to represent both:
<ul>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Function input</li>
<li>Function output</li>
</ul>
In the next sections we will look at the remaining three containers in Manglang:
<ul>
<li>Tuples</li>
<li>Stacks</li>
<li>Strings</li>
</ul>
We will see that each of them can be seen as syntactic sugar sprinkled on dictionaries.
</p>

<h2 id="tuples">2.b. Tuples</h2>
<p>Tuples of values are written as:</p>
<pre>
(3 17.5 yes 'A')
</pre>
<p>
We use tuples to group different atomics as an ordered collection. The elements of the tuple can have different types, just as the elements of a dictionary can have different types. To see the similarity consider this example:
</p>
<pre>
{
  tuple = (3 17.5 yes 'A')
  dictionary = {item0=3 item1=17.5 item2=yes item3='A'}
}
</pre>
These are two different ways of storing the same data.
Tuples in Manglang can be seen as syntactic sugar sprinkled on dictionaries so that we can use the first more concise notation instead of the second more verbose notation.
Conceptually we can think of a tuple as a dictionary but instead of accessing an item in it using <code>name@dictionary</code> we access it with and index like <code>tuple!index</code>. A common use case for tuples is to send multiple inputs of different types to a function.

<h2 id="stacks">2.c. Stacks</h2>
<p>Stacks of values are written as:</p>
<pre>
[3 6 4]
</pre>
There are two differences between tuples and stacks:
<ul>
<li>All elements of a stack should have the same type. The elements of a tuple can have different types.</li>
<li>We can generate a new stack from a base stack by adding or removing elements from it. A tuple is static.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If we have a <code>stack</code> we can get the stack with all elements except the first via <code>drop!stack</code>. The function <code>put</code> is used to construct a new stack by putting a new item on top of the stack:
</p>
<pre>
put!(7 [4 5 2])
</pre>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
<pre>
[7 4 5 2]
</pre>
<p>Here is another example program with some stack operations:</p>
<pre>
{
  a = [3 6 4]
  b = take!a
  c = drop!a
  d = put!(b c) 
}
</pre>
<p>The input above is evaluated to the output below:</p>
<pre>
{
  a = [3 6 4]
  b = 3
  c = [6 4]
  d = [3 6 4]
}
</pre>
In summary, we interact with stacks by accessing its members using <code>take</code> and <code>drop</code> and via the function <code>put</code>. The standard library of Manglang provides more functions that works on stacks but they are all built on top of this basic interface.

<h2 id="strings">2.d. Strings</h2>
<p>
Strings are written as:
</p>
<pre>
"Manglang"
</pre>
<p>
They can be seen as stacks of characters. Example of a program using functions on strings:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = "Manglang"
  b = take!a
  c = drop!a
  d = reverse!a
  e = put!('E' a)
}
</pre>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
<pre>
{
  a = "Manglang"
  b = 'M'
  c = "anglang"
  d = "gnalgnaM"
  e = "EManglang"
}
</pre>

<h2 id="tables">2.e. Tables</h2>
<p>
What we call Tables in Manglang are sometimes referred to as associative arrays in other languages. A table holds pairs of elements: keys and values. We use the syntax:
<pre>
&lt;key1:value1 key2:value2&gt;
</pre>
Tables are used for situations where you want to quickly get or put the value in a container based on a dynamic key. We do this using the built-infunctions <code>get!(key table default_value)</code> and <code>put!((key value) table)</code>. The following example takes a stack of numbers and computes a table, where each key is a number and the corresponding value counts how many times the number occurs in the stack:
<pre>
{
  stack = [1 2 1 1 3 4 2]
  counts = <>
  while stack
    x = get!(take!stack counts 0)
    counts = put!((take!stack inc!x) counts)
    stack = drop!stack
  end
}
</pre>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
<pre>
{
  stack = []
  counts = <1:3 2:2 4:1>
  x = 2
}
</pre>
Tables are perhaps the most complicated and least used container in Manglang. But they are handy in some cases.
Tables are somewhat similar to dictionaries, but also different:
<ul>
<li>Names are used to access values in dictionaries. Keys are used to access values in tables. A key can be of any type.</li>
<li>The names of a dictionary are static. The keys of a table are dynamic. Dynamic means that they are not known until the program is evaluated.</li>
<li>The values in a dictionary can be of different types. The values in a table should all have the same type.</li>
<li>The content of a dictionary can be updated during its constraction phase, but not later on. The content of a table can be updated at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="container_summary">2.f. Container Summary</h2>
<pre>
-----------+---------------+---------+-------------------------------------------
Container  | Item Type     | Size    | Mutability
-----------+---------------+---------+-------------------------------------------
Dictionary | Heterogeneous | Static  | Mutable during constrution, then immutable
Tuple      | Heterogeneous | Static  | Immutable
Stack      | Homogeneous   | Dynamic | Immutable
String     | Homogeneous   | Dynamic | Immutable
Table      | Homogeneous   | Dynamic | Mutable  
-----------+---------------+---------+-------------------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
Dictionaries and tuples are both heterogeneous and static containers. They are used when we know exactly how many items we want to store in the container. We use dictionaries if we want to refer to each item by name. We use tuples if we want to refer to each item by position. By heterogeneous we mean that the items in a container can have different type.
</p>
<p>
Stacks, strings and tables are all homogeneous and dynamic containers.

By homogeneous we mean that each item in a container has the same type.

By dynamic we mean that they are suitable for adding and removing items as the program is evaluated.

Stacks and strings are immutable, which means that if we add or remove items we get a new copy of the original container with the updated change, whereas the original container is not modified. Tables on the other hand are mutable, so putting new items in a table actually modifies the original container.
</p>

<h2 id="generic_programming">2.g. Generic Programming</h2>
<p>
Stacks, strings, tables share some basic operations. The following operations can be used to iterate through these dynamic containers:
<ul>
<li><code>take!container</code></li> takes an item from the container. Can be seen as dereferencing an iterator.
<li><code>drop!container</code></li> returns a view of the container with one item removed. Can be seen as incrementing the iterator so that it points at the next item.
<li><code>if container then ... else ...</code> can be used to check that the container is not empty. Can be seen as checking whether the iterator has a successor or not.</li>
<li><code>container!index</code> can be used to get the item at the specified index. The container is interpreted as a function which takes an index as input and outputs an item.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Stacks, strings, tables also share the following operations for creating new containers:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>put!(item container)</code></li> adds an item to the container. Creates a new container for stacks and strings, but modifies tables.
<li><code>clear!container</code></li> creates an empty container of the same type.
</ul>
</p>
By relying on this shared interface we can write generic functions that work similarly on both stacks, strings and tables. For some examples of this you can take a look at the <a href="functions.html">standard library documentation</a>,  or look inside the
<a href="https://github.com/mabur/mang_lang/blob/master/src/built_in_functions/standard_library.h">standard library implementation</a>.

<h1 id="control_flow">4. Control Flow <img src="control_flow.png" width=48 height=48></h1>

<h2 id="if">4.a. If</h2>
<p>
The expression <code>if a then b else c</code> is evaluated to b or c depending on if the answer to the question a is yes or no.
<ul>
<li>
The following values are interpreted as <code>no</code> or falsey:
    <ul>
        <li>boolean <code>no</code></li>
        <li>number zero <code>0</code></li>
        <li>empty stack <code>[]</code></li>
        <li>empty string <code>""</code> </li>
        <li>empty table <code><></code> </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
All other values are interpreted as <code>yes</code> or truthy.
</li>
</ul>
Consider this example:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = [0 1]
  b = if a then
      take!a
    else
      2
  c = if b then "hello" else "world"
}
</pre>
<p>
This program is evaluated to:
</p>
<pre>
{
  a = [0 1]
  b = 0
  c = "world"
}
</pre>

<h2 id="is">4.b. Is</h2>
<p>
The <code>is</code> operator is used to check for equality among many alternatives. It is similar to switch-case or pattern matching in other languages. Consider this example where we use the is operator to find the corresponding characters:
</p>
<pre>
{
  opening = '{'
  closing = is opening
    '(' then ')'
    '[' then ']'
    '{' then '}'
    '<' then '>'
    else  '.'
}
</pre>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
<pre>
{
  opening = '{'
  closing = '}'
}
</pre>
The <code>is</code> operator can be seen as syntactic sugar for a more verbose combination of the <code>if</code> operator and the <code>equal</code> function:
<pre>
{
  opening = '{'
  closing = if equal?(opening '(') then ')'
    else if equal?(opening '{') then '}'
    else if equal?(opening '[') then ']'
    else if equal?(opening '<') then '>'
    else '.'
}
</pre>

<h2 id="while">4.c. While</h2>
<p>
In Manglang you can loop while constructing a dictionary:
</p>
<pre>
{
  x = 10
  tot = 0
  while x
    tot = add!(tot x)
    x = dec!x
  end
}
</pre>
The input above is evaluated to the output below:
<pre>
{
  x = 0
  tot = 55
}
</pre>
<p>
The loop decrements x until it is zero and then finishes.
Definitions in a dictionary can only be updated / mutated while the dictionary is constructed.
Once it has been constructed it is immutable and cannot be updated.
</p>

<h2 id="for">4.d. For</h2>
<p>
You can use a for-each-loop to visit each item in a container:
</p>
<pre>
{
  tot = 0
  numbers = [1 2 3]
  for number in numbers
    tot = add!(tot number)
  end
}
</pre>
This is syntactic sugar for the equivalent while loop:
<pre>
{
  tot = 0
  numbers = [1 2 3]
  while numbers
    number = take!number
    tot = add!(tot number)
    numbers = drop!number
  end
}
</pre>
Both versions above evaluate to the output below:
<pre>
{
  tot=6
  numbers=[]
  number=3
}
</pre>

<p>
There are two things to note about for-loops in Manglang. The first thing is that in the expression <code>for item in name</code> both <code>item</code> and <code>name</code> are names. This means that a container needs to first be given a name before it can be used in a for-loop. The container CANNOT be inlined directly like <code>for item in [1 2 3]</code>. Another thing to note is that the for loop rebinds these names for each iteration of the loop and leave them in their final state after the loop. So in this sense a for-loop consumes the name of the container. If you want to refer to the full container also after the loop then you need to assign a different name to it before entering the for-loop.
</p>

<h1 id="functions">5. Functions <img src="function.png" width=48 height=48></h1>

<h2 id="function_application">5.a. Function Application</h2>
<p>
We have already seen some examples of calling / applying functions in Manglang.
A function is called using <code>!</code> like <code>function_name!input</code>.
We see function application as a command and hence use the symbol <code>!</code> after the verb that names the functions.
Functions take a single value as input.
However, this single value can be a stack or tuple or dictionary, that has multiple values inside.
</p>
<pre>
{
  stack = [4 2 1]
  sum0 = sum!stack
  sum1 = sum![4 2 1]
  stack2 = put!(3 stack)
}
</pre>
<p>
This program is evaluated to:
</p>
<pre>
{
  stack = [4 2 1]
  sum0 = 7
  sum1 = 7
  stack2 = [3 4 2 1]
}
</pre>
<p>
Manglang does not have any special operators for arithmetics, boolean, stack operations etc.
Instead functions are used for all computations.
Function calls can be nested like this:
</p>
<pre>
mul!(add!(1 2) sub!(7 2))
</pre>
<p>
This program is evaluated to <code>(1+2)*(7-2) = 3*5 = 15</code>.
Function calls are right associative.
Manglang does not support currying.

<h3>Applying Predicates</h2>
Manglang encourages using <code>?</code> instead of <code>!</code> for applying functions that return a boolean value, a.k.a. predicates. Applying such a function is like asking a question. As an example consider the following functions from the standard library that operate on ascii characters:
<pre>
{
  is_upper = in c out less_or_equal?[65 number!c 90]
  is_lower = in c out less_or_equal?[97 number!c 122]
  to_upper = in c out
      if is_lower?c then
          character!sub!(number!c 32)
      else
          c
  to_lower = in c out
      if is_upper?c then
          character!add!(number!c 32)
      else
          c
}
</pre>
</p>

<h2 id="function_definition">5.b. Function Definition</h2>
<p>
Functions are defined using they keywords <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> like this:
</p>
<pre>
{
  square = in x out mul!(x x)
  result = square!3
}
</pre>
<p>
A function definition is on the form <code>in x out expression</code>
where x is the name of the input and expression is the output.
Functions are first class values and can be given a name by putting them inside a dictionary.
Here are some examples of defining and calling functions:
</p>
<pre>
{
  square = in x out mul!(x x)
  inc = in x out add!(x 1)
  dec = in x out sub!(x 1)
  count = in stack
    out
      if stack then
        inc!count!drop!stack
      else
        0
  a = square!3
  b = inc!3
  c = dec!3
  d = count![3 7 3 8 2]
  e = count!"apple"        
}
</pre>
<p>
This program is evaluated to:
</p>
<pre>
{
  square = in x out mul!(x x)
  inc = in x out add!(x 1)
  dec = in x out sub!(x 1)
  count = in stack
    out
      if stack then
        inc!count!drop!stack
      else
        0
  a = 9
  b = 4
  c = 2
  d = 5
  e = 5        
}
</pre>
<p>
The if-then-else operator is used to choose what value to return based on a condition.
Functions can be recursive like the <code>count</code> example above.
Function definitions and computations can be broken up into smaller parts by using dictionaries:
</p>
<pre>
{
  square = in x out mul!(x x)
  square_norm = in vec3 out result@{
    x = vec3!0
    y = vec3!1
    z = vec3!2
    result = add!(square!x square!y square!z)
  }
  vector = (3 4 5)
  result = square_norm!vector
}
</pre>

<h2 id="function_tuple_definition">5.c. Function of Tuple Definition</h2>
<p>
Manglang provides syntactic sugar for defining functions that take multiple input,
in the form of a tuple.
Here are some examples of equivalent ways of defining and calling functions: 
</p>
<pre>
{
  area1 = in rectangle out mul!(rectangle!0 rectangle!1)
  area2 = in (width height) out mul!(width height)
  rectangle = (5 4)
  a = area1!rectangle,
  b = area2!rectangle,
  c = area1!(5 4)
  d = area2!(5 4)
}
</pre>
<p>
The functions <code>area1</code> and <code>area2</code> are equivalent.
They expect the same input and return the same result.
<code>area2</code> just uses syntactic sugar to make its implementation more concise,
by unpacking the elements of the input tuple.
</p>


<h2 id="function_dictionary_definition">5.d. Function of Dictionary Definition</h2>

<p>
Manglang provides syntactic sugar for defining functions that take multiple input,
in the form of a dictionary with named entries.
Here are some examples of equivalent ways of defining and calling functions: 
</p>
<pre>
{
  area1 = in rectangle out mul!(width@rectangle height@rectangle)
  area2 = in {width height} out mul!(width height)
  rectangle = {width = 5 height = 4}
  a = area1!rectangle
  b = area2!rectangle
  c = area1!{width = 5 height = 4}
  d = area2!{width = 5 height = 4}
}
</pre>
<p>
The functions <code>area1</code> and <code>area2</code> are equivalent.
They expect the same input and return the same result.
<code>area2</code> just uses syntactic sugar to make it its implementation more concise,
by unpacking the elements of the input dictionary.

<h1>Setup</h1>

Manglang is implemented in C++ and does not depend on any external libraries. You can build it in different ways.


<h2>Setup via CMake and Make</h2>
You can build Manglang from a terminal on a system that has a C++ compiler and Cmake and make.
First go to the directory where you want to install manglang and then follow these steps:
<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:mabur/mang_lang.git</code></li>
<li><code>mkdir mang_lang/src/build</code></li>
<li><code>cd mang_lang/src/build</code></li>
<li><code>cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..</code></li>
<li><code>make</code></li>
</ol>
This should produce two programs:
<ol>
<li>The Manglang unit tests which you can try by running <code>./tests</code></li>
<li>The Manglang interpreter which you use to run a program written in manglang.
   You can try running the programs found in the examples directory:
<code>./manglang ../../examples/hello_world.txt</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Setup via CLion</h2>
You can also build Manglang using CLion:
<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:mabur/mang_lang.git</code></li>
<li>Open <code>mang_lang/src/CMakeLists.txt</code> in CLion and build.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Setup via Visual Studio and CMake</h2>
<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:mabur/mang_lang.git</code></li>
<li>Open <code>mang_lang/src/CMakeLists.txt</code> in CMake and generate a Visual Studio project.</li>
<li>Open the Visual Studio project and build it.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Setup via Visual Studio</h2>
<ol>
<li><code>git clone git@github.com:mabur/mang_lang.git</code></li>
<li>Create a new Visual Studio project and add the header and source files in <code>mang_lang/src/</code> to it and.</li>
<li>Build the Visual Studio project.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Embed Manglang</h2>
Manglang can also be embedded in another C++ program by including <code>src/mang_lang.h</code> and using the function <code>std::string evaluate(std::string code);</code>
