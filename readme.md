# Manglang

Manglang is an experimental programming language that is:

- **Simple** and **minimal**, instead of feature rich. It is easy to understand, both for humans and computers.
- **Functional**, instead of imperative or object oriented. It is suitable for describing data and calculations, rather than interactive programs with side effects.
