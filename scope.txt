* compilation
* evaluation of program

IMPLEMENTATION
* Outside of function body.
  - Symbols are refering to constant values.
  - The symbols could be assigned when constructing the AST.
    - But let's skip it for simplicity.
  - The symbols could share immutable data using pointers.
    - But let's skip it for simplicity.
* Inside function body.
  - Symbols are potentially refering to variable values.
  - The values can be assigned each time the function is called.
  - It is harder to share data in this context.
  - Let's create copies for each assignment.
* What do we get when we evaluate a symbol refering to a functions, with possible captures?
  - How about functions as input to functions?
  - How about functions as output of functions?
  - How about recursion?
    - If we send function A to function B, then we only
